# Artic Circle Animation
This repository attempts to programmatically animate some of the diagrams shown in Mathologer's Christmas 2020 video!

[![Sample video of animations](https://img.youtube.com/vi/IFMbMchj_Zo/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFMbMchj_Zo)

The code written depends on [manim community edition](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim).

Once manim is installed you can run 

```
python -m manim video.py VideoAnimation -p
```

To generate the sample video. Feel free to play around!
